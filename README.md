# KirbyVariants
Using primitive 3D objects we recreated the famous Kirby and 4 of its variants


Part 1. Creating Traditional Kirby

Step 1: Creating class for Kirby
![CreatingKirby1](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/8e7439ff-ca1d-470e-aeb2-2926b03b2d1f)
Description: Let's start by creating an Empty Object with the purpose of having some sort of class for our Traditional Kirby. This is optional, but we named it TraditionalKirby so we can easily identify our objects.

Step 2: Creating Kirby's Body
![CreatingKIrby2](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/f53d983b-2ca2-43f1-a0bc-9f9a381e5ee8)
Description: Create a sphere, that will represent Kirby's body. Modify as you wish so it is similar to kirby. After editing our sphere, right-click on its name in the Hierarchy panel, this should be ubicated on the left side of your screen. While right-clicking on the new sphere, drag it inside of your empty object previously created. After doing so, the sphere should appear right below the empty object and indented. This inidcates that the sphere belongs to the class TraditionalKirby.

Step 3: Completing Kirby

Description:Using the different 3D Objects, we will add arms,legs and eyes to our Kirby class. Use the manipulative tools(move,rotate,scale) to make Kirby as you wish. Add every object you create to Kirby's class by repeating the click and drag method. Additional: Name every object in relation of what part of Kirby's body it is representing so that it is easieer to understand and read. Plus this adds tidiness to our designs.

Note: Observe how every object we created is labeled with a different body part and most importantly, they are indented below TraditionalKirby.

Step 4: Kirby Prefab

Description: After we have finished customizing our Kirby, we will right-click on the entire class,TraditionalKirby, and drag it to the Assets folder in the Project panel on the bottom of our screen. This will create a "Prefab" of our Kirby. A prefab is basically the same as a class.

Description: In the Assets folder, click on the newly created prefab. Your Kirby model should appear in a blue plane. Here you can edit your Kirby as you wish and the changes will be reflected in the original Scene.
