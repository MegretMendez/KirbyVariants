# KirbyVariants
Using primitive 3D objects we recreated the famous Kirby and 4 of its variants


Part 1. Creating Traditional Kirby
Step 1: Creating class for Kirby

Description: Let's start by creating an Empty Object with the purpose of having some sort of class for our Traditional Kirby. This is optional, but we named it TraditionalKirby so we can easily identify our objects.

Step 2: Creating Kirby's Body

Description: Create a sphere, that will represent Kirby's body. Modify as you wish so it is similar to kirby. After editing our sphere, right-click on its name in the Hierarchy panel, this should be ubicated on the left side of your screen. While right-clicking on the new sphere, drag it inside of your empty object previously created. After doing so, the sphere should appear right below the empty object and indented. This inidcates thatt the sphere beongs to the class TraditionalKirby
