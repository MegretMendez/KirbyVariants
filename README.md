# KirbyVariants
Using primitive 3D objects we recreated the famous Kirby and 4 of its variants


Part 1. Creating Traditional Kirby

Step 1: Creating class for Kirby
![CreatingKirby1](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/8e7439ff-ca1d-470e-aeb2-2926b03b2d1f)
Description: Let's start by creating an Empty Object with the purpose of having some sort of class for our Traditional Kirby. This is optional, but we named it TraditionalKirby so we can easily identify our objects.

Step 2: Creating Kirby's Body
![CreatingKIrby2](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/f53d983b-2ca2-43f1-a0bc-9f9a381e5ee8)
Description: Create a sphere that will represent Kirby's body. Modify as you wish so it is similar to kirby. After editing our sphere, left-click on its name in the Hierarchy panel, this should be ubicated on the left side of your screen. While left-clicking on the new sphere, drag it inside of your empty object previously created. After doing so, the sphere should appear right below the empty object and indented. This inidcates that the sphere belongs to the class TraditionalKirby.

Step 3: Completing Kirby
![CreatingKirby4](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/b11229b7-dd32-4469-8af1-fd96f679645d)

Description:Using the different 3D Objects, we will add arms,legs and eyes to our Kirby class. Use the manipulative tools(move,rotate,scale) to make Kirby as you wish. Add every object you create to Kirby's class by repeating the click and drag method. Additional: Name every object in relation of what part of Kirby's body it is representing so that it is easieer to understand and read. Plus this adds tidiness to our designs.

Note: Observe how every object we created is labeled with a different body part and most importantly, they are indented below TraditionalKirby.

Step 4: Kirby Prefab
![CreatingKirby5](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/df68200b-d691-4a13-b5fa-7f528a10b093)

Description: After we have finished customizing our Kirby, we will left-click on the entire class,TraditionalKirby, and drag it to the Assets folder in the Project panel on the bottom of our screen. This will create a "Prefab" of our Kirby. A prefab is basically the same as a class. 

![CreatinmgKirby6](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/f0525277-3904-4ae3-88e8-78e5b493bb98)
Note: Observe that the TraditionalKirby object now appears in blue with a cube besides it. This indicates that this is an object of a prefab.
![CreatingKirby6](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/c214463c-0df6-4ce6-b21c-fbfdd73f393b)

Description: In the Assets folder, click on the newly created prefab. Your Kirby model should appear in a blue plane. Here you can edit your Kirby as you wish and the changes will be reflected in the original Scene.

Part 2. Using Traditional Kirby to create 4 variants
![CreatingKirby7](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/142a0938-3b5d-4cf8-a468-16194ecbf923)
Description: To create the 4 Kirby Variants, we will once again drag the original prefab to the Assets folder. This time a message will be displayed on the screen. 

![CreatingKirby8](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/20e150ac-748d-4aac-9692-840bf90bba63)
Description: The message will ask if we desire to create a new Prefab or if we prefer to create a Variant Prefab of our TraditionalKirby. We will choose to create a Variant Prefab. This creates a duplicate of the original prefab but is totally independant from the original. We can distinguish Original Prefabs from Prefab Variants because even though Prefab Variants are also displayed in blue with a cube, the cube has one of its faces shaded. Remember to change the name of the Prefab Variant to easily distinguish them. 

![CreatingKirby9](https://github.com/MegretMendez/KirbyVariants/assets/142510070/c8a9408d-c30d-426a-9003-4583077d9949)
Description: Inside the new prefab variant, edit your Kirby to make it resemble one of the variants you chose. 

The picture below shows an example of a Kirby Variant:

Note: Adding colors is optional. But adding colors is an advantage becuase we can better appreciate the little details of our Variants. At the bottom of the page you will find and "Additionals" section, where how to add colors will be explained in addition to other optional features.

Repeat "Part 2. Using Traditional Kirby to create 4 variants" until you have all your Kirby Variants created and styled to the maximum accuracy you can achieve.

Part 3. Creating Terrain for Kirbys

Prt 4. Optional(Adding color, water and texture to the terrain)
